You can find the materials for every topic inside the corresponding folder.

General information
===================

* If you install python packages locally on your machine, we recommend using a
  pip environment, which can isolate the installed packages for an application.
* When Quantum TEA packages are used, the examples in the folders are designed
  for qtealeaves v1.1.x and qmatchatea v1.1.x which are the ones available
  via pip install (status May 2024).
